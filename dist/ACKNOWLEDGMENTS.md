# History of core IMDbPHP libraries
Originally, this WordPress plugin originated from an IMDBPHP library created by [Andreas Itzchak Rehberg](https://izzy.rehbergs.info/ "Personal Websie"). A few years later, when Andreas got tired, T. Boothmman took over [IMDbPHP](https://github.com/tboothman/imdbphp/ "IMDbPHP GIT"). Today, Lumière is on the latter library improved by [Duck700](https://github.com/duck7000/imdbGraphQLPHP "IMDbGraphQLPHP GIT").
Lumiere WordPress plugin has been actively developped and maintained for almost 20 years.
