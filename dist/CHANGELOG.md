v.4.1
* [feature] Auto title widget can be excluded on a per-post basis. New option in the post edition that allows to exclude a specific post from the auto title widget. Brings a much needed flexibility for blogs using the auto title widget feature. (added the new options in Metabox_Selection class and new rules in Widget_Frontpage)

* [feature] Popups spinners vastly improved, work with all modal windows. Clicking on any link in popup will trigger a new spinner if the loading time is > 1 second.
* [feature] Popups layout vastly reviewed and enhanced, link color changed, added a picture for illustrating the link for movie searching
* [feature] The color of links to taxonomy pages is now different than to popups, for better understanding of what comes next. More respectful of plugin user css, not modifing links into the posts except in Lumière area (used to change to grey color the links)
* [feature] Pages can include Lumière widgets. Only post previously could. Exceptions to auto title widget can also be added into pages.
* [bug] Custom stylesheet added in personal theme folder wasn't working (now unregister main style and register the custom style in Core class if a parent or child theme is found)
* [bug] Frontpage and administration stylesheets standardised, less conflict should be witnessed with themes
* [bug] If using Highslide modal window with OceanWP theme, pictures were somewhat taken between an extra box created by OceanWP (detection if OceanWP is installed and highslide is activated in oceanwp plugins class, then deactivating OceanWP boxes)

* [bug] Bootsrap spinner for bootstrap fixed, it correctly disappears when page is fully loaded
* [bug] Pictures in popup where smaller depending on the results. Fixed their size for both movies and people

* [bug] A function to launch a popup in post edition was not working (finalised blocks/opensearch/index.js)
* [bug] Legacy widget wasn't working, who knows since when. If you use classic widget plugin, you can use Lumière legacy widget.

* [bug] When reseting options in General options, no confirmation message was displayed.
* [bug] Plugin Update wasn't working (Casting now to string in class update the option 'imdbHowManyUpdates', which doesn't actually make sense but works)
* [technical] Gutenberg block registration is now done in more modern way (using register_block_type() and block.json). Splitted "add imdb link" and "open search" into two blocks. Widget is also registered that way.
* [technical] Due to Gutenberg block limitation, a class is now added in &lt;span data-lum_movie_maker=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. The plugin remains fully compatible with the span without class. (Edited regexes in class movie to take into account the possiblity that spans can include a class)
* [technical] Plugins loading is fully OOP
* [technical] Bot banning status changed from 403 to 400, which is more appropriate, not banning bots on taxonomy or normal post pages
* [technical] Notifications are only shown in Lumière admin options pages. If a taxonomy file is not installed, always nag the user to install it.
* [technical] Lot of cleaning, standardised css classes, removed many unused methods in css and php, factorized and using more dedicated traits, using official WordPress way to include blocks (block.json), more standard WordPress string escaping
* [technical] The Polylang language forms in taxonomy pages for people now uses $_Get instead of $_Post, required to make the AMP form work (edited Polylang and Taxonomy_People_Standard clases in this regard)
* [technical] Replaced post metatada 'imdb-movie-widget-bymid' by 'lumiere_widget_movieid' and 'imdb-movie-widget' by 'lumiere_widget_movietitle'. Deleted obsolete post metada keys 'lumiere_queryid_widget_input' and 'lumiere_queryid_widget' The changes are done through the update numer 15.
* [technical] Moved the blueprint.json in the correct asset folder (meant to be on wordpress.org, actually).

v.4.0.2
* [feature] Thumbnail pictures (those which are displayed automatically into the posts, in cache, in popups) are now automatically resized should they weight more that 80kb, which should display all pages faster. Maintained the possiblity to click on these thumbnails to display the big posters (Cover option in Lumière admin).
* [bug] Refresh cache person was broken (left a bracket in glob search in Cache_Tools::cache_refresh_specific_file())
* [bug] Refresh cache person didn't recreate the big picture
* [bug] The movie/person big poster wasn't producing expected effects. Changed the way IMDBPHP lib ImageProcess class works: it now resizes the thumbs only if they weight too much (above 80 Ko).

v.4.0.1
* [feature] If year/month/day of birth/born date are unknown in people popups, display "(year/month/day unknown)" instead of displaying a 0

* [feature] "Back" button in people popups is displayed only if it's not the first page to be displayed.

* [bug] Privacy policy was not displayed in admin Policy Guide, options-privacy.php?tab=policyguide (replaced in title "Lumière" with "Lumiere" in the title of wp_add_privacy_policy_content() function)
* [bug] Into the post, widget and popup picture: if "Display only thumbnail" was selected, huge picture was displayed. (Changed 100em to 100px in abbstract link maker and popups)
* [bug] Cron refresh cache sometimes doesn't retrieve people. Trying a new trick (added a sleep() between movies and people)
* [bug] Trivia in people popups: if less than tree trivias, layout was broken (removed extra div in display_misc() method)
* [bug] On some specific environments, taxonomy template copy wasn't working. (wp_get_referer() wasn't set in copy template taxonomy class, removed the redirection, found using WordPress playground)
* [bug] On some very specific environments, cache display in admin cache options didn't work (GLOB_BRACE couldn't be used, removed it from the cache classes, found using WordPress playground).
* [technical] Added blueprint.json in assets for WordPress Live Preview use.
* [technical] Popups now always ban users when there is no HTTP_REFERER => it's always bots, no need to let them index and call.

* [feature] Added in the general advanced options an option to add an extra delay when querying the IMDb website. Meant to avoid the HTTP 504 errors thrown when too many requests in a row are processed. 0 seconds by default, but can be increased to add a delay. If the data are already cached, no further delay, it's as fast as it used to be. Usefull when using the new auto refresh option, if you cache is large it may be welcome to add such a delay.
* [feature] Better way to *display taxonomy items*, such as genre. It now displays all terms related to the item (i.e. movie's genre -> action). Make sure to delete all tags and visit your posts, taxonomy will be automatically created.

* [bug] Fixed the taxonomy system, it now properly creates HTML links towards taxonomy pages within widgets/into the posts sections (now it's hierarchical, it's not using polylang functions anymore, edited classes movie and polylang and taxonomy). It is advised to delete all taxonomy tags you may have, so new are create again.
* [bug] Cache folder creation fixed (in class settings, lumiere_create_cache() was checking if a folder exists before actually creating it)
* [bug] Visibility: When IMDb links to popups where created in WordPress block editor (post edition), they were not visible. Now, an icon clearly shows that a link to popups was created in the post's text.

* [technical] Added Bingbot and Googlebots to the banned bots, since it doesn't respect the "no follow" rule.
* [technical] Rewrote the bot banning. It is now executed before doing IMDb searches, avoiding cache creationg (and 504 HTML errors when calling IMDb website)
* [technical] In admin, notices for update/reset options is now WP notification system compliant (using transients in child classes to display notifications messages set in admin parent class)

* [bug] Fixed pictures were not display on first pass (*personal IMDbPHP* change, if pictures were not reduced in size, a return false was preventing them from showing on first pass)

* [bug] If role for movie's actor line (in Class movie) did not exist, was resulting in php error

v.3.9.7
* [bug] Data-Taxonomy admin page: detecting system was too complicated and led to always display a notification if a template in theme folder was found. Simplified.
* [bug] Updates were never run if plugin was auto-updated. (Added new function lumiere_on_lumiere_upgrade_autoupdate() in 'automatic_updates_complete' hook in Core class)
* [bug] In some environments, help section of admin pages triggered fatal error ( global $wp_system was not initialised, added new require_once and initialisation of WP_Filesystem() in class-help)

* [bug] PHPStan fixes, notably add_actions() and add_filter() permutations.
* [technical] The weekly automatic delete is now daily (cron lumiere_cron_deletecacheoversized)

User should carefully select a legacy or block based widget in WordPress block pages according to whether they have a old WordPress install (prior to 5.8) or installed a Classic Widget plugin that brings back the pre-5.8 widget interface.
* [technical] Improved the "how to" section related to auto title widget.
* [technical] Splitted class-widget into three class, 1 for admin and 2 for Frontpage. Streamlined the code. Legacy widget using Widget_Frontpage class. Totally separated the logic and the layout.

v.3.9.2
* [bug] Bootstrap popup size was not correctly working on WordPress.com environment. Works better, but there is still room for improvement.
* [bug] Popups were not displaying movies/people/search data on WordPress.com environment. Using now a different hook to display layout in those popups, passed from 'get_header' to 'the_posts'.
* [bug] Cache folder could be created above the level of wp-content. It is now limited to create a the cache folder into wp-content, which leads to more versatility of the plugin in multisites environments (using WP_CONTENT_DIR instead of ABSPATH constant to build the cache folder). Works perfectly on WordPress.com environment.
* [bug] Layout was not available when visting first Lumière! admin options page (options-general.php?page=lumiere_options, link to Lumière options in WP Settings section). Added that page to conditional pages to display the layout.
* [technical] lumiere_array_contains_term() in class utils was not escaping special characters provided in array of URLs. Made the function more versatile, using it in Core class.

v.3.9.1
* [bug] Under very specific Linux environments such as wordpress.com, debug file could not be created. Changed the creation process in class-logger and added create_log() method.

v.3.9
* [feature] If a new taxonomy template is found, a notice is shown in admin Lumière options (will keep nagging until update is processed)
* [feature] Lumière will not be compatible with plugins that promote a web of spammers. First plugin to enter the hall of shame: RSS Feed Post Generator Echo, paid plugin used to make ghost websites with ads and make money. If such plugin is activated, Lumière will automatically be deactivated.
* [bug] Under unusual circomstances, class-taxonomy-people-standard.php was failing to retrieve an IMDbPHP class name. Added throwing an exception
* [bug] Tagline in movies popup shows up again
* [bug] Gutenberg's movie type select text in Lumière movie's block was not shown, fixed block/index.js

* [bug] Wrong annotation for class-settings.php (extra OPTIONS_WIDGET properties)
* [bug] IMDbPHP search was not working for people on some sporadic circumstances
* [bug] Creating Cache folder (method settings->lumiere_create_cache() ) was not entirely functional. New logic implemented in the method, should take care of any new cache path provided, default path case when installing the plugin, and alternative cache paths (aka inside Lumière plugin folder)
* [bug] If cache was not utilised, IMDB pictures were tried to be retrieved anyway (IMDbPHP needs a folder to store and display pictures). Edited frontend classes (movie, popup-movie and popup-person) and theme taxonomy-people-standard
* [bug] Uninstall did not remove the cache path as saved in database, but Lumiere\Settings::LUMIERE_CACHE_OPTIONS instead
* [bug] Utils::lumiere_notice() warning (case 4) was buggy. Fixed and implemented dismissible notices.
* [technical] Properly using composer scripts in src, not copied to the production vendor folder with composer anymore
* [technical] Using composer autoload, removed all home-made autoloads. Can't use PSR-4 autoloading, since WordPress file naming is not PSR-4 compliant.
* [technical] Bootstrap Window Maker is now relying on composer for updating
* [technical] Unloading various stylesheets in AMP link makers, as in AMP pages those are not found.

* [feature] modified imdb.css (improvement made by Jeremie Boniface, I'm not able to manage these things)
* [feature] rating (inside a post & widget) displays now pictures instead of numbers; depending of good (or bad) feeedbacks, value $imdbwidgetratingnopics has to be implemented into plugin (to permit users to get back to old display, with the numbers) -> Jeremie Boniface demand

(if specified), person: 3/fixed a property missing in initialization, Fixed goofs(), trailers(), and trivia() )
* [major] every admin settings section (cache, widget & general) has its own preferences storage (new foreign keys: $imdb_admin_values, $imdb_widget_values,$imdb_cache_values, whereas $imdb_config_values is dead). As a result of this, resetting General options won't interfere with Cache options, and vice versa.

* [feature] imdb pictures displayed both in widget and inside a post can be "highslided". To achieve this, activate "Display highslide popup" option and turn "Display only thumbnail" to "no" (and put a small size value, as "150" per example).
* [bug] (somewhat): if highslide popup is active, search engine bots will index several hundred thousands of movies and actors, since they can now follow an href. Except if you do not care at all about space and bandwith, it could down your website quickly. Moved links to highslide popups from href="" to src: '' (inside javascript) and closed the href tag. To prevent any kind of search engine crawling in a place where it should not crawl, added also a robots.txt file (not convinced about its usefulness, though), and a test at the begining of popup-header.php.
* [bug] some translated french strings were wrong
* [bug] when several directors were found, it was missing space or comma to display -> added comma

* [bug] in config-widget.php, a value for imdbwidgettitle (and one other) section was wrong
* [bug] a value $test (imdb-movie.inc.php) was wrongly named -> renamed to $genre
* [bug] wrong value for "Plugin directory" (config.php) -> modified

* [feature] new way to include movies inside a post: use tags (new way) [imdblt]movies name[/imdblt] instead of (old way) &lt;?php lumiere_external_call() ?> + Exec-PHP plugin. That means this release doesn't need any more any kind of third party plugin! Compatibility with the old way kept.
